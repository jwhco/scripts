# Useful Scripts and Tools

## Overview

Subdirectories indicate automation scripts for Utilities. The goal is to make these scripts platform-independent; however, most commands will be for macOS and Linux.

## Modules

- **Opml2RSSList**. Dump an OPML file into an RSS feed. Playlist migration.
- **SeoHelpers**. Help with technical Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
- **Text2Markdown**. Support migration to markdown from common formats and tools.
- **TidyObsidian**. Quality assurance scripts for Obsidian, Zettlr, and LogSeq.
- **MarkdownTools**. Data extraction from markdown files using text analysis.
- **winAutomate**. Scripts to setup environment in Windows using one-click.
- **WordPressOpt**. Reference and optimization concepts for WordPress hosting.

As these tools mature, they may be forked off into standalone libraries and modules. Until then, each are managed here. When opening an issue, mention module in description.

## Warning

Use these scripts at your own risk. Look over the code carefully. Some have hardcoded paths for this office environment. Some scripts were for one-time use and may no longer function as expected.
