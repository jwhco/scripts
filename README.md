# Useful Scripts and Tools

## Overview

Automation scripts for Utilities indicated by subdirectories. The goal is to make these scripts platform independent, however, the majority of command-line will be MacOS and Linux.

## Organization

Under the main directory will be a project folder specific to the tool. Under that folder each script set will have its own README. In the best case the script itself will have documentation embedded.

## Warning

Use these scripts at your own risk. Look over the code carefully. Some have hardcoded paths for the office environment.
