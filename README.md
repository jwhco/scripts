# Useful Scripts and Tools

Automation scripts for Utilities indicated by subdirectories. The goal is to make these scripts platform independent, however, the majority of command-line will be MacOS and Linux.

Under the main directory will be a project folder specific to the tool. Under that folder each script set will have its own README. In the best case the script itself will have documentation embedded.
