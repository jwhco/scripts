# Useful Scripts and Tools

## Overview

Automation scripts for Utilities indicated by subdirectories. The goal is to make these scripts platform independent, however, the majority of command-line will be MacOS and Linux.

## Tools

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

## Organization

Under the main directory will be a project folder specific to the tool. Under that folder each script set will have its own README. In the best case the script itself will have documentation embedded.

## Warning

Use these scripts at your own risk. Look over the code carefully. Some have hardcoded paths for this office environment. Some scripts were for one time use and may not function as expected anymore.
