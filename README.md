# Useful Scripts and Tools

## Index

- Opml2RSSList. Dump an OPML file into an RSS feed.
- SeoHelpers. Help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
- Text2Markdown. Support migration into Obsidian.
- TidyObsidian. Quality assurance scripts for Obsidian.

## Overview

Subdirectories indicate automation scripts for Utilities. The goal is to make these scripts platform-independent; however, most commands will be for macOS and Linux.

## Tools

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

## Organization

Under the root directory will be a project folder specific to the tool. Under that folder, each script set will have its own README. In the best case, the script itself will include documentation.

## Warning

Use these scripts at your own risk. Look over the code carefully. Some have hardcoded paths for this office environment. Some scripts were for one-time use and may no longer function as expected.
