    "## Requirements\n",
    "- Read front matter `tags: ` to develop keywords for analysis. Turn these into keywords, as would other tags, use them to category content with ngram analysis.\n",
    "- Use the `type: ` element to filter out non content materials. Focus on {Report, Article, Newscaster}. Save {Social, Discussion, Message} when script can better determine speaker.\n",
    "- Extract `date: ` as creation date of note if file creationn not earlier. Use the last modified date from the file and `published: ` relevant to timeline.\n",
    "- Read YAML front matter into arrays with a pointer to the file itself. These values could be an index to group files without reading body text.\n",
    "- Read front matter to find Google Analytic UTM values to match with marketing stats from social media and analytics servers. Consider UTM the index for the file itself.\n",
    "- Read Google Analytics UTM front matter, turn into a heigharchy tree. Have pointers back to the files to map channel performance then do analysis of context of messages.\n",
    "- Use an inline YAML to identify permalinks for content published. Try to only have one `permalink: ` per note. Permenant links can be used as keys to find content too."
