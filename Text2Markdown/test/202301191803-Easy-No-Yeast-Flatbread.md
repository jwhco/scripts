## Recipe

Makes 8-10 servings

Ingredients:

For the dough:

2 cups (250g) Flour (plain/whole wheat)

1 1/3 cups (340g) Plain yogurt

1 teaspoon Salt

2 teaspoons Baking powder

For brushing:

4 tablespoons (60g) Butter, softened

2-3 cloves Garlic, crushed

1-2 tablespoons Herbs of your choice (parsley/coriander/dill)

Directions:

1. Make the bread: In a large bowl, combined flour, baking powder

and salt. Add yogurt and mix until soft and smooth dough form.

2. Divide the dough into 8-10 equal size pieces. Roll each piece

into a ball. Cover the balls and rest for 15 minutes.

3. Meanwhile prepare the butter mixture: in a small bowl mix

butter, crushed garlic and chopped parsley. Set aside

4. Roll out each ball into a circle about 1/4 cm thick.

Heat a large cast-skillet or a non-stick pan over medium-high

heat. When the pan is hot, add one circle of dough to the dry

skillet and cook for about a 2 minutes, until the bottom

browns and bubbles appear. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes more.

6. Remove from heat and immediately brush with the butter

mixture.
