# WordPress Update Services List Project

## Purpose

- Maintain a quality and active list of WordPress ping services. Focus is primarily on XML-RPC site with reach.
- Tools to maintain list for in-house publications. Providing actionable ping services to minimum spamming, or low quality pushes.
- Make sure hosting provider doesn't block or prevent pings. Need some way to check that in case they get stingy with access.
- Address the "larger is better" focusing on ping services that work, that have reach, and that aren't spamming the publication across other sites.
- It's about getting fresh content indexed as fast as possible. However, look at tools to third-party URL ping inbound quality backlinks. Make sure link partners and fans are being rewarded.

## Requirements


- User runs script to validate ping services in `Update-Services.txt` providing a report. Use a real ping address. Report indicates which services are to be removed.
- Script to determine if XML-RPC ping services are available. If so, remove the non-XML-RPC to prevent spamming services. Give preference to XML-RPC.
- User manually completes details for https://feedshark.brainbliss.com/ from template provided for in-house publications. Follow procedural. 
- Script sorts, dedupes, and saves `Update-Services.txt` as quality control. Extract domains, validate they are valid, only keep entries with valid domain.
