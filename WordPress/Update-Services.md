## Overview

-   Maintain a quality and active list of WordPress ping services. Focus is primarily on XML-RPC site with reach.
-   Tools to maintain list for in-house publications. Providing actionable ping services to minimum spamming, or low quality pushes.
-   Make sure hosting provider doesn't block or prevent pings. Need some way to check that in case they get stingy with access.
-   Address the "larger is better" focusing on ping services that work, that have reach, and that aren't spamming the publication across other sites.
-   It's about getting fresh content indexed as fast as possible. However, look at tools to third-party URL ping inbound quality backlinks. Make sure link partners and fans are being rewarded.
-   Use `Ping-Bookmarks.txt` to understand bulk services. Determine minimum viable details to push an RSS feed.
-   Understand that ping traffic isn't human. It cannot buy. Focus on ping sources that send traffic. To determine this, either code the URL, or look at traffic sources. Look at time between first search on resent updates.

## Requirements

-   User runs script to validate ping services in `Update-Services.txt` providing a report. Use a real ping address. Report indicates which services are to be removed.
-   Script to determine if XML-RPC ping services are available. If so, remove the non-XML-RPC to prevent spamming services. Give preference to XML-RPC.
-   User manually completes details for https://feedshark.brainbliss.com/ from template provided for in-house publications. Follow procedural.
-   Script sorts, dedupes, and saves `Update-Services.txt` as quality control. Extract domains, validate they are valid, only keep entries with valid domain.
-   Because some of these services don't have a primary website, test them by doing a ping. Have a mechanism to provide a CSV with details expected by services, then run a few pings from command line. Typically a ping service will return `RESULT: OK` and close.
-   Any tool capable of pinging from the command line must throttle. Command line tools sends to an agent, the agent uses threads to ping, however, adds time between similar domains or multiple contacts.
